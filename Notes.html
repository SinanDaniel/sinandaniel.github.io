                    <li>1.1 Collaboration: Collaboration means working on a project with other people. This concept helps remove bias from our projects. It also helps us get different views on things and ultimately helps us solve things faster. This video also introduces us to the “think-pair-share” method where people brainstorm on their own about a topic and share them with other people. </li>
                    <li>1.2. Program Function and Purpose: Innovations can be both digital and physical. Some examples for digital innovations include games, social media and business and some examples of physical innovations are computers and smartphones. Inputs are pieces of data that a computer takes in and processes. Types of inputs are auditory, visual, tactile and text. Program outputs are the data that the computer returns.</li>
                    <li>1.3. Program Design and Development: The goal of this investigation is to make the goal of the programmers as clear as possible. In this stage, programmers establish what their purpose is and the problem they're trying to solve. They figure out what their program will need to do, and also what their program will need in order to function properly. Ways of investigating include collecting data through communication channels, user testing and interviews with clients.Documentation is very important at this stage because it helps us keep track of what we have done and also makes it easier to give out credit to everyone at the end without being unfair.</li>
                    <li>1.4. Identifying and Correcting Errors: There are four different types of errors. These include logic errors, syntax errors, run time errors and overflow errors. Hand tracing is manually tracking your variables values as your program goes along. Many hand-tracing methods use charts to organize these values. Using visualizations or visual representations of your code. Many programmers use debuggers, or programs designed specially to test for bugs.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.1 Collaboration: Collaboration means working on a project with other people. This concept helps remove bias from our projects. It also helps us get different views on things and ultimately helps us solve things faster. This video also introduces us to the “think-pair-share” method where people brainstorm on their own about a topic and share them with other people. </li>
                    <li>1.2. Program Function and Purpose: Innovations can be both digital and physical. Some examples for digital innovations include games, social media and business and some examples of physical innovations are computers and smartphones. Inputs are pieces of data that a computer takes in and processes. Types of inputs are auditory, visual, tactile and text. Program outputs are the data that the computer returns.</li>
                    <li>1.3. Program Design and Development: The goal of this investigation is to make the goal of the programmers as clear as possible. In this stage, programmers establish what their purpose is and the problem they're trying to solve. They figure out what their program will need to do, and also what their program will need in order to function properly. Ways of investigating include collecting data through communication channels, user testing and interviews with clients.Documentation is very important at this stage because it helps us keep track of what we have done and also makes it easier to give out credit to everyone at the end without being unfair.</li>
                    <li>1.4. Identifying and Correcting Errors: There are four different types of errors. These include logic errors, syntax errors, run time errors and overflow errors. Hand tracing is manually tracking your variables values as your program goes along. Many hand-tracing methods use charts to organize these values. Using visualizations or visual representations of your code. Many programmers use debuggers, or programs designed specially to test for bugs.</li>

                    <li>2.1 Binary Numbers: A way of representing data is bits. A “byte” consists of a sequence of 8 bits. The binary system consists of two digits."1" represents an electrical signal in your computer being on. "0" represents an electrical signal in your computer being off. </li>
                    <li>2.2 Data Compression: Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data. Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space. An example of this would be compressing a file on a computer and it being the same when opened with the same amount of data. This would be an example for lossless data compression.</li>
                    <li>2.3 Extracting Information from Data: Data sets pose challenges such as the need to clean data, incomplete data, invalid data, and the need to combine data sources.</li>
                    <li>2.4 Using Programs with Data: Programs are used in an interactive and iterative way when processing information to allow users to gain knowledge and insight about data. Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>3.1 Variables and Assignments: Variables are parts of the code that holds values. Some languages such as Swift provide users with the option to use lists, booleans etc. to make using values easier. The "←" operator can be used to assign a value to a variable.</li>
                    <li>3.2 Data Abstraction: An index is a method used to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers. Data abstraction is making a lot of variables easier to work with. This is usually done with lists, booleans, dictionaries etc. Overall, it makes the code easier to write for the coder.</li>
                    <li>3.3 Mathematical Expressions: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task.Algorithms can be expressed in multiple ways, such as diagrams, pseudocode etc. All  algorithms can be constructed using combinations of selection, sequencing  and iteration.</li>
                    <li>3.4 Strings: Strings are characters written between quote marks used to represent text. A substring is a part of an already existing string. They are often used for things like names, words, or sentences. You can combine, break apart, and search through strings.</li>
                    <li>3.5 Boolean Expressions: A boolean is one of  true or false. The value of it can be either "1" or "0". It uses operators such as  AND, OR, and NOT. They are commonly used in loops and conditionals.</li>
                    <li>3.6 Conditionals: In programming, conditionals are statements that let the code decide what to do depending on specific circumstances. Whether a particular Boolean statement is true or false determines which code to use: if, else if, and else. For instance: -if one condition is true, take action; -else, take another action if another condition is true; -else, take action if none of the conditions are true.</li>
                    <li>3.7 Nested Conditionals: Conditionals inside other conditionals are called nested conditionals. This indicates that another conditional is contained inside an if, otherwise if, or else statement. They are employed to manage increasingly intricate decision-making procedures.</li>
